Cobra CLI to set up project.
Go Gin framework for ease of development
Swagger for API docs

This App is designed for Muzz' coding challenge.

Set up
ensure you have golang and docker installed.

I've assumed a DEV environment for the sake of this assessment.
I have structured the cmd serve folder to allow to a grpc server for future usage(more to show how I go about doing this as aI know Muzz use GRPC)


I want to make sure users cannot match with someone they have already seen. so discover will filter that.
